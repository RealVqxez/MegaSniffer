# Megasniffer
I, Vqxez, am the original owner of Megasniffer and this repository.
And I am not responsible for the damages done to you or any other person including your PC and everything under the sun.
If you roam around the deep web you might have found this hack so I brought it to the surface because I wanted to please all of those little skids who don't know how to code.

Main description:
Megasniffer is a hack that sniffs packets from your connected internet, decrypts the SSH obfuscation, and sends the details in a notepad or your desired text editor/viewer
Information including: email addresses, IP's, passwords, bank account details, and other useful information about someone or many people at once.

Megasniffer is coded in: C++ for the easy use of the console and making it look better, Python for having a huge library and the use of sockets and modules, and a little bit of batch but that is not included in this version of the hack due to saftey reasons and past incidents involving me going to court for someone being dumb and not being careful with this hack.

If you have any questions about the hack or just want a new hacking friend, you can dm me through discord which will be down below.
